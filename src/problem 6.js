/*
 * The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

 * The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
 * 
 * (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
 * Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural 
 * numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
